The flight was designed to expand the flight envelope and demonstrate aerial-imaging capabilities by taking stereo images of a region of interest to the west. Ingenuity was commanded to climb to an altitude of 33 feet (10 meters) before translating 492 feet (150 meters) to the southwest at a ground speed of 9 mph (4 meters per second). At that point, it was to translate 49 feet (15 meters) to the south while taking images toward the west, then fly another 164 feet (50 meters) northeast and land.\r\n\r\nTelemetry from Flight Six shows that the first 150-meter leg of the flight went off without a hitch. But toward the end of that leg, something happened: Ingenuity began adjusting its velocity and tilting back and forth in an oscillating pattern. This behavior persisted throughout the rest of the flight. Prior to landing safely, onboard sensors indicated the rotorcraft encountered roll and pitch excursions of more than 20 degrees, large control inputs, and spikes in power consumption.\r\n\r\nDespite encountering this anomaly, Ingenuity was able to maintain flight and land safely on the surface within approximately 16 feet (5 meters) of the intended landing location.","webcast_live":false,"location":"Airfield B, Jezero crater, Mars","date_precision":null,"response_mode":"normal","duration":null,"updates":[{"id":546,"profile_image":null,"comment":"Ingenuity's sixth flight encountered an anomaly during flight - the vehicle was able to recover and safely land however an issue in its navigation camera caused unreliable navigation information that resulted in oscillations during flight.","info_url":"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/305/surviving-an-in-flight-anomaly-what-happened-on-ingenuitys-sixth-flight/","created_by":"spacelaunchnowadmin","created_on":"2021-05-27T20:11:45Z"}],"last_updated":"2024-03-05T17:26:15Z"},{"id":260,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/events/260/","name":"Tianzhou-2 Docking","info_urls":[],"vid_urls":[{"priority":10,"source":"www.youtube.com","publisher":null,"title":"China's Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft docks with space station module","description":"For  more:https://www.cgtn.com/videoChina's #Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft docked with Tianhe, the core module of the country's space station, at 5:01 a.m. (Be...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rqUfY7LsFnI/maxresdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqUfY7LsFnI","type":null,"language":{"id":1,"name":"English","code":"en"},"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"live":false}],"image":{"id":1235,"name":"[AUTO] Tianzhou-2 Docking - image","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/tianzhou-2_dock_image_20210510181619.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305192114.jpeg","credit":null,"license":{"id":1,"name":"Unknown","priority":9,"link":null},"single_use":false,"variants":[]},"date":"2021-05-29T21:01:00Z","slug":"tianzhou-2-docking","type":{"id":2,"name":"Docking"},"description":"The Tianzhou-2 resupply cargo ship successfully docked to the new Chinese Space Station, bringing supplies necessary for the arrival of the first crew onboard Shenzhou-12.","webcast_live":false,"location":"Chinese Space Station","date_precision":null,"response_mode":"normal","duration":null,"updates":[{"id":526,"profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png","comment":"Updated docking time (~midnight UTC) per various reports, confirmation pending.","info_url":null,"created_by":"Cosmic_Penguin","created_on":"2021-05-18T09:37:36Z"}],"last_updated":"2024-03-05T17:25:18Z"},{"id":560,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/events/560/","name":"Boeing Starliner OFT-2 Media Teleconference","info_urls":[{"priority":10,"source":"www.nasa.gov","title":"Invites Media to Cover Boeing’s Orbital Flight Test-2 Mission","description":"Media accreditation is open for prelaunch and launch activities for NASA’s Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2) mission to the International Space Station, the second uncrewed flight test of the company’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft for the agency’s Commercial Crew Program.","feature_image":null,"url":"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-invites-media-to-cover-boeing-s-orbital-flight-test-2-mission","type":{"id":1,"name":"Official Page"},"language":{"id":1,"name":"English","code":"en"}}],"vid_urls":[{"priority":10,"source":"www.youtube.com","publisher":null,"title":"Media Briefing: NASA-Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 Mission Overview","description":"","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Jd6q1q1-T8/maxresdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jd6q1q1-T8","type":{"id":1,"name":"Official Webcast"},"language":{"id":1,"name":"English","code":"en"},"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"live":false}],"image":{"id":1115,"name":"Boeing Starliner render","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/boeing_starline_image_20210721065053.jpeg","thumbnail_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305191658.jpeg","credit":"NASA","license":{"id":4,"name":"NASA Image and Media Guidelines","priority":0,"link":"https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-brand-center/images-and-media/"},"single_use":false,"variants":[]},"date":"2022-05-03T16:00:00Z","slug":"boeing-starliner-oft-2-media-teleconference","type":{"id":20,"name":"Press Event"},"description":"NASA and Boeing will hold a joint media teleconference to discuss the OFT-2 mission and provide an update on spacecraft readiness.
