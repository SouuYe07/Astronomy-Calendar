The mission's main goal is to obtain a sample of at least 60 grams from 101955 Bennu, a carbonaceous near-Earth asteroid, and return the sample to Earth for a detailed analysis.\r\n\r\nRehearsals will be performed before the sampling event, during which the solar arrays will be raised into a Y-shaped configuration to minimize the chance of dust accumulation during contact and provide more ground clearance in case the spacecraft tips over (up to 45°) during contact. The descent will be very slow to minimize thruster firings prior to contact in order to reduce the likelihood of asteroid surface contamination by unreacted hydrazine propellant. Contact with the surface of Bennu will be detected using accelerometers, and the impact force will be dissipated by a spring in the TAGSAM arm.\r\n\r\nUpon surface contact by the TAGSAM instrument, a burst of nitrogen gas will be released, which will blow regolith particles smaller than 2 cm (0.8 in) into the sampler head at the end of the robotic arm. A five-second timer will limit collection time to mitigate the chance of a collision. After the timer expires, the back-away maneuver will initiate a safe departure from the asteroid.","webcast_live":false,"location":"101955 Bennu","date_precision":null,"response_mode":"normal","duration":null,"updates":[],"last_updated":"2024-03-05T17:23:53Z"},{"id":173,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/events/173/","name":"Soyuz MS-16 Undocking","info_urls":[{"priority":10,"source":"www.nasa.gov","title":"Landing Coverage Set for NASA Astronaut Cassidy, Space Station Crew","description":"NASA will provide live coverage of the return to Earth for agency astronaut Chris Cassidy and two Russian cosmonauts Wednesday, Oct. 21, after six months aboard the International Space Station.","feature_image":null,"url":"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/landing-coverage-set-for-nasa-astronaut-chris-cassidy-space-station-crew","type":null,"language":{"id":1,"name":"English","code":"en"}}],"vid_urls":[{"priority":10,"source":"youtu.be","publisher":null,"title":"NASA Live: Official Stream of NASA TV","description":"Direct from America's space program to YouTube, watch NASA TV live streaming here to get the latest from our exploration of the universe and learn how we dis...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/21X5lGlDOfg/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://youtu.be/21X5lGlDOfg","type":null,"language":{"id":1,"name":"English","code":"en"},"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"live":false}],"image":{"id":967,"name":"Soyuz MS in orbit (MS-19)","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soyuz_ms_in_orb_image_20240313130407.jpeg","thumbnail_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soyuz_ms_in_orb_image_thumbnail_20240313130407.jpeg","credit":"ESA/NASA/T.
